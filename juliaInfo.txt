-The Julia Set-
The Julia set is described by all the solutions 
to a specific equation where the given c is convergent.
Quadratic Julia sets are generated by the quadratic mapping
              zn+1  = f(z) =  zn2 + c
for fixed c.
 For almost every c, this transformation generates a fractal. The resulting 
 object is not a fractal for c= -2 and c=0 although it 
 does not seem to be known if these two are the only such exceptional values.
