-The Dragon Curve-

This curve can be described by continually folding a piece of paper in half over and over(i.e.
left over right over and over again.
Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right.
Fold it in half again to the right.
If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become
a 90-degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL, i.e. the second
iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in
half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the
unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL â€“ the third iteration of the
Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half to the right to
create further iterations of the Heighway dragon
(in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).
